Wordle Game Description
This project is a Wordle-like game built using React. The objective of the game is to guess a 5-letter word within six attempts. Each guess provides feedback with color-coded hints: green for correct letters in the correct positions, yellow for correct letters in the wrong positions, and gray for incorrect letters. The game includes features such as a dark mode toggle and animations for enhanced user experience.

Features and Enhancements
Core Game Logic:
Hardcoded List of 5-Letter Words: The game uses a predefined list of 5-letter words for the player to guess from. Example list: ['apple', 'brave', 'crane', 'dwarf', 'eagle'].

Rules for Processing Guesses: The game checks if the guessed word matches the target word and provides feedback to the player based on the comparison.

Feedback Mechanism:

Green: Correct letters in the correct position.

Yellow: Correct letters in the wrong position.

Gray: Incorrect letters.

Guess Validation: Ensures that only valid words from the predefined list can be submitted by the player. Displays an appropriate message if the guess is invalid.

User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX):
Grid Display: Displays previous guesses with color-coded feedback. Shows up to six rows, one for each guess.

Game Status Messages: Displays messages indicating whether the player has won or lost the game. Example messages: "Congratulations, you won!" or "Out of attempts! The word was 'apple'."

New Game Functionality: Includes a “New Game” button to reset the game state and start a new game. Resets the target word, guesses, and messages.

State Management:
Track Game State: Manages the state of guessed words, remaining attempts, and the current status of the game. Uses React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and lifecycle events.

UI Updates: Ensures the user interface updates correctly based on the changes in game state. Renders new guesses, feedback, and game status messages dynamically.

Styling:
CSS Styling: Uses standard CSS for styling the game components to provide a visually appealing interface. Styles include color coding for feedback, layout for the grid and input elements, and overall theme.

Responsive Design: Ensures the game is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Uses flexible layouts and media queries to adapt to different screen sizes.

Optional Enhancements:
Animations: Adds animations for letter feedback to enhance the user experience. Uses CSS animations to animate the color changes for each letter.

Dark Mode Toggle: Provides a button to toggle between light and dark modes for better user accessibility. Uses CSS classes to switch themes and updates the UI accordingly.
